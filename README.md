# singleScreenUdacity
A single screen app displaying information about Udacity. This app is part of the Google Developer Challenge Scholarship.

This app has only simple functionality. Links were added for the respective information type (e.g. a click on the address opens a maps app). No additional functionality was implemented as this project was about getting familiar with building more complex xml layouts.
